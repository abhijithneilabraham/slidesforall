# slidesforall
A hub repository for sharing slides for everyone to refer.

## Goal

When the tech industry is growing so fast, the requirement for improving your existing knowledge is important, especially if you present that knowledge in front of an audience, and speaking in conferences, etc. 

Here, we try to structure all such resources, and you can refer them in order to improve your own slides that you prepare for the big event. 

## Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request:
- Refer the folder structure, arranged in domains and levels. Include DD/MM/YY format in the filename.
- If possible, mention the event you were speaking at, or the occasion you used the slide for, in either filename or first slide.
- In case of non-ppt resources, refer 'other_resources' inside each folder.
